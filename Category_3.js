[{"POI_ID":"20","POI_Latitude":35.639829,"POI_Longitude":-82.546989,"POI_Title":"Tsali","POI_Description":"Tsali is one of the most \r\nrecognized MTB trail systems \r\nin the country. With nearly 39 \r\nmiles of designated trail, there is \r\nsomething for everyone. The main \r\ntrail system is made up of 4 loops \r\nthat wrap around peninsulas and \r\nshowcase some amazing views of \r\nFontana Lake and the GSMNP. \r\nThe jewels of this system are \r\nthe Right and Left loop with the \r\nLeft Loop Overlook being one of \r\nthe best views around. The trails \r\nare well kept and offer little in \r\nregards to technical challenge, \r\nespecially for the more advanced \r\nrider. However, what they lack in \r\ntechnical challenge they make up \r\nfor in speed and flow. Beginners \r\nmight find some of the short \r\nclimbs challenging but achievable.","POI_Image1":"","POI_Category":"3","POI_Difficulty":"Intermediate","POI_TrailTime":"1.5-2 Hrs","POI_TrailTime2":"","POI_TravelTime":"45 Minutes","POI_Phone":"","POI_URL":"","POI_Additional_Info":"","POI_Elevation":"","POI_VerticalDrop":"","POI_Season":"","POI_Highlights":"","POI_AccessRating":"","POI_Class":"","POI_Length":"","POI_Level":"","POI_Put_In":"","POI_Take_Out":""},{"POI_ID":"21","POI_Latitude":35.356996,"POI_Longitude":-83.13014,"POI_Title":"Wayehutta","POI_Description":"This trail system is primarily \r\nused for ATV and other off road \r\nvehicles but offers some fun \r\nchallenging trail to those brave \r\nenough to give it a shot.

Of the 10 miles you will \r\nbe looking at climbing the first \r\n5 and descending the last 5. Yep, \r\nit’s pretty much straight up and \r\ndown. It’s a hard push for the \r\nmost advanced riders to ride to \r\nthe top but the descent is well \r\nworth it. Make sure you have good \r\nbrakes and be careful!

The climbs \r\nand the descents will challenge \r\nyour technical ability as well as \r\nyour fitness so be prepared to \r\nwork a little.

Brush \r\nCreek can be run as an out and \r\nback or a point to point if you \r\nwant to car shuttle. It is a 7 mile \r\none way single track trail that \r\nwinds its way above the Ocoee \r\nlake.
